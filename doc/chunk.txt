DESCRIPTION                                      *chunk-description*

Vim runs in to problems when you want to read really really big files. the
whole file gets read into memory which is the first big problem, but then also
features like syntax highlighting, indentation etc, will make vim even slower.

vim-chunk solves this by allowing you to read big files one chunk at a time.

I built this plugin to help me read huge log files. See also my vim-searchalot
plugin (link below) to search those log files efectively.

GETTING STARTED                                  *chunk-getting-started*


1. Install the plugin using your favorite plugin manager.
2. Open vim and enter the command: `:Chunk <path/to/file>`
3. You will now see the first 15000 lines of the file you provided.
4. Chunks are per default 5000 lines long. Call `:ChunkNext` to view lines
   5000-20000, and `:ChunkPrevious` to move back one chunk.
5. Setup mappings
   This plugin does not automatically set any mappings as that might mess up
   your current mappings. But here are some I suggest using. Copy them to your
   vimrc and change the mappings to fit your needs if you want.
>
  " move forward and backward through the chunks
  nnoremap ]c :call ChunkNext()<CR>
  nnoremap [c :call ChunkPrevious()<CR>
  " from a quickfix window match, jump into a file using chunk (e.g. after searching)
  autocmd BufWinEnter quickfix nnoremap <leader>c :call LoadChunkFromQuickfix()<CR>

Why I wrote this plugin and think it is usefull~

Alternatives~

Other plugins (see descussions section for alternatives) try to get around
this by disabling some slow features, but this only works up to a point.

You can disable some features, or use the
[BigFile](https://github.com/LunarVim/bigfile.nvim) to do it for you, but
another way to solve the problem would be to simply not read the entire file in
at once, but Chunking it.
